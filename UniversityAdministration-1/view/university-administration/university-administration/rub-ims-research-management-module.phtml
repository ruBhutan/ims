<h3><a id="RMRPresentIssues">Present System & Issues</a></h3>
<h4>Present System</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Currently, all research activities and administration has been carried out manually. Records and information are maintained manually.</li>
	<li>There is also no system of collecting and gathering research publication database.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues</h4>
<uL>
	<li>Most of the tasks for the promotion of research in RUB are conducted manually where concerned officers use whatever means of communications available like, telephone, fax and e-mail to achieve a task. This oftentimes is an extra burden and it also creates confusion among parties and slows down the work.</li>
	<li>Research forms and paperwork are first printed, then submitted and manually compiled. Then the result is put online creating a double work. </li>
	<li>At the moment capacity development (seminars and workshops) are conducted according to the availability of faculty and staff time, which is mainly through word of mouth. This is method is time consuming for the organizers, more importantly it creates an avenue for people to complain. </li>
	<li>Annual work plan in the dept. needs a proper scheduling in consultation with colleges to have a continue activities through out the year and to decrease the number of ad-hoc activities.</li>
